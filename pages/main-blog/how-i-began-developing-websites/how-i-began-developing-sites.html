            <section class="main-blog">
                <p class="introduction">Hey reader! Its been a while since ive written on this blog. I've been busy with school and other projects, but now im ready to share with you how I got started with web development.</p>
    
                <h3 class="subheading">Where I began.</h3>

                <p class="maintext">As a kid (like many) I've always been into technology, whether it be the new Xbox or a new thousand pound PC I couldn't afford. But one thing I was really interested in was the look of the software those things ran. I know, "KJ, out of all the amazing things tech has to offer, the <i>design</i> interested you the most?". Yes, it did. I know, <i>booooooring.</i>

                    <br>
                <br>
                You see,  how something is designed makes the experience of using that thing feel better. A choppy, ugly-looking software would put me off using even the greatest tech. Even as a kid I was hung up on graphics. UI and UX was something I appreciated highly at the time. I just had no idea it was called UI/UX.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subheading">Fast Forward</h3>

                <p class="maintext">
                    As I grew up, I still had a huge interest in technology. It was coming to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education" id="bloglink">GCSEs</a> (a UK qualification you take at the end of Year 11) and I had done absolutely zero studying. I was more interested in Forex and Digital marketing (although, I was quite good at it). GCSE time comes and I get pretty average grades and my parents are pissed. If you haven't guessed, I have African parents. They weren't happy.
                    <br><br>
                    However, during the summer I knew I kinda messed up my grades, and so began looking into fields I was interested in. Now, software engineering was something I had in the back of my mind for years. I had always heard of the phrase; I just never knew what it actually meant. So, I began researching, finding out that software engineering was just an umbrella term for multiple areas of software engineering. Like Front-end, Back-end, Full-stack, DevOps, Security engineers etc.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subheading">How'd I pick?</h3>

                <p class="maintext">
                    Picking between these fields was actually easier than expected. At the time, I was funded with prop firm <a href="https://ftmo.com/">FTMO</a> (they provide risk-free capital to traders), and their web applications not only looked good, but felt great. I wanted to make something like this. During this time though, I had heard about web development. I thought it was one of those careers that didn't pay much and those that only made Operating Systems and developed software for rockets made the most. But I was so, so wrong.

                    <br><br>

                    A quick look at salaries changed my perspective. How could someone that sits there making stuff look pretty make so much money? The answer? There is a demand for expertise in a field with few experts. It's so much more than just making a website look pretty. The logic behind the page requires so much detail and attention. As tech changes, Web developers need to know how to adapt to new technologies, make sure code doesn't break, troubleshoot fast, work with third-party tools, and more. All while making sure it looks pretty. There's a demand for <i>good</i> developers that know what they're doing.

                    <br><br>

                    This is something I wanted to do, just the satisfaction of making your ideas come to life and interactive was enough for me. And so I began learning about how to get into the industry. This is how I ended up here. I began with front-end development. Learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript (which I am still learning). I built some basic components to challenge my CSS (flexbox, grid, etc.). 
                    <br><br>
                    I then picked up the preprocessor <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" id="bloglink">SCSS</a> (which was used to build this website), and a CSS framework called <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" id="bloglink">TailwindCSS</a> (which I will talk about another time). With these I built projects to get a solid understanding of them. That's how I picked up SCSS and TailwindCSS in a day. The knowledge I had on CSS played a major role in that too, though. I still have quite a way to go with front-end development. I still need to get JavaScript down and then pick up a JS framework like <a href="https://reactjs.org/" id="bloglink">React</a>. But in the meantime, I've made some good progress for someone that started 2-3 months ago (at the time of writing this). Now I need to begin building applications with vanilla JavaScript, and after I'm confident, ill begin reacting. After this, and a few front end projects, it would be safe to say that im a React developer.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subheading">To conclude</h3>

                <p class="maintext">My Web Development journey so far has been incredibly enjoyable. I only began hitting some rode blocks learning JavaScript, but I expected to. I knew JS was not going to be as easy as HTML and CSS. Although I did previously have some knowledge of arrays, operators and datatypes, DOM manipulation caught me off guard. It's just a hurdle that I can overcome with more practice though, and im excited to overcome it.</p>
